# Instagram-redesign

This is a core Front End Project where I'm trying to create a replica of Instagram using styling with CSS!
I have Majorly used Flex & Flex types(Space-between, Space around etc) to generate the design. Everything has been hard coded including the display picture & name for ease. 
For feeds I'm using a third party API which generates random images everytime you refresh the page. 
CHEERS!!
